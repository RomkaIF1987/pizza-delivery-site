            <p>Inspired by my love for food and people, the first Pizza Delicious was opened on November 26, 1983. It was built upon traditional principles and a commitment to quality, service, and long-standing relationships with communities, customers, and employees.

                I grew up in an Italian neighborhood where the emphasis on food making was its simplicity and flavor. I remember the aroma of fresh sauce being simmered at one of our neighborâ€™s homes; the pungent smell of freshly grated cheese as Josephina sprinkled it on the pasta; and the warmth and love that exuded from the dinner table as the family ate together.

                At Pizza Delicious, we serve generous portions of food, made with quality ingredients by people who care. We are not fancy. We are not about sun-dried tomatoes, wood-burning ovens, and $10 mushrooms.
